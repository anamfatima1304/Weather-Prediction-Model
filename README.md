Weather Prediction is an important factor. Weather affects a lot of our day-to-day activities. The aim of this project is to create a basic level weather prediction system that would tell the temperature in degree Celsius based on Humidity, Wind_Speed, Wind_Bearing, Visibility, Pressure, hour, month and Precip_Type.
